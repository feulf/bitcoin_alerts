Bemoki
This project checks the price of bitcoin for you and text or call you when an alert is triggered. We're evolving this app to make it able to also buy and sell bitcoins from your Coinbase account, so if overnight the price drop you'll be able to buy them at a lower rate, or if the price go too high and you want to sell, this app will do it for you.

Important: if you plan to use the Coinbase API deploy this app only on your local machine. Do not deploy the app online with the ``` COINBASE_API_KEY ``` or your Coinbase account could be hacked.

In case you don't have a Coinbase account you can create one using my referral URL and we'll both get $5 worth of bitcoin:
