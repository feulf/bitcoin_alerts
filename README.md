Bemoki
======

This project text or call you when a Bitcoin price alert is triggered. You can set alerts with a simple text message
``` 
Alert 900 
```

or 
``` 
Alert 900 call
```

Bemoki also implement the Coinbase API and the functionalities to buy and sell Bitcoin at specific price. This functionality is experimental, you should not run this app with real money and you should never upload the ``` COINBASE_API_KEY ``` online.
